"""XYSY's door — the one thing a web page at xysy.ai can knock on.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Hermes' own local server refuses xysy.ai by name. Measured 2026-08-10 on a real
`hermes serve`: an identical request labelled `Origin: https://xysy.ai` comes back
400 "Disallowed CORS origin", while `Origin: http://localhost:5173` sails through.
That is a hardcoded regex in hermes_cli/web_server.py with a written reason —
otherwise any website you visited could read and change Hermes' config and secrets.
It is not a setting, and patching theirs would strand every user on a fork.

So XYSY brings its own door. Hermes imports this file when the plugin is enabled,
which gives us a process that is already running and already has Hermes in it; we
open a second, much smaller listener beside Hermes' own and answer only for us.

    ~/.hermes/plugins/xysy/dashboard/{manifest.json, api.py}
    enabled via  plugins.enabled  in config.yaml  (or one click in Hermes' UI)

THE THREAT, STATED PLAINLY
--------------------------
Every website you visit can make your browser send requests to 127.0.0.1. This door
can drive your applications. So the interesting question is never "can XYSY reach
it" — it is "why can nothing else". Four answers, and all four are required:

  1. IT ONLY LISTENS TO THE LOOPBACK. Nothing off this machine can reach the port.

  2. ORIGIN ALLOWLIST, ON THE PREFLIGHT *AND* ON THE REQUEST. A browser asks
     permission before sending anything interesting, and we say no to everyone
     except XYSY. This is what stops evil.example driving your Rhino from a tab you
     forgot you had open.

  3. A BEARER TOKEN, ALWAYS. Origin checking alone trusts a header a browser sets
     honestly and a script does not. The XYSY Local Agent's rule — "a caller with
     no Origin is not a browser, so trust it" — is the wrong way round, and it is
     deliberately NOT repeated here: no Origin means no browser means it still
     needs the token.

  4. PAIRING. A token is not enough on its own, or any XYSY user anywhere could
     drive THIS computer. The door is paired to exactly one account: the first
     token is verified with xysy.ai, the account it names is remembered, and from
     then on only that account gets in.

Nothing here is typed by a person. The browser is already signed in to xysy.ai, it
fetches its own short-lived key, and hands it to the door over loopback — the same
handover the Local Agent already uses to connect a computer to an account.

# THE RUN ITSELF IS NOT NEW. `xysy_hermes_run.py` was written for the XYSY agent and is
# already Hermes-shaped Python: it builds a per-run HERMES_HOME so a run only starts the
# connectors it declares, raises Hermes' 50-tool-call ceiling, and streams tool-by-tool
# events through an observer plugin instead of scraping stdout. All the door does is
# reach it, because the browser cannot.
#
# It is invoked as a PROCESS, not imported. A run is minutes of somebody's real work
# driving real applications; if it falls over it must not take the door — or Hermes —
# with it. Same reason the agent shells out to it today.
#
# ⚠️ The runner lives in two places (the agent bundle and here). They are kept identical
# by scripts/sync_hermes_runner.py, which fails loudly rather than letting them drift —
# this repo has lost hours to one file living in four places before.

# is a Claude Desktop extension: with Claude closed the screen said "XYSY can't see this
# Mac" and stopped there. Steps 3-6 ask about HERMES, and this file runs inside Hermes, so
# the door answers them and Claude is not needed on the machine at all.
#
# Steps 1 and 2 - install Hermes, install the model server - are NOT here, and it is not an
# oversight that can be corrected later: a door hosted by Hermes cannot report on whether
# Hermes is installed. Those two belong to the person, and the screen now says so plainly
# instead of offering a button that only works when Claude happens to be open.
#
# The shape of every answer below matches the Local Agent's tool of the same name, because
# the SAME runner produces it. The UI must not be able to tell which door it came through -
# if it could, every screen would grow a second dialect. `via` is for humans reading logs.

# XY-DOORROOT - the door makes itself PERMANENT (v0.5.0).
#
# Sean, 2026-08-11, from the second Mac: the setup text ended with `hermes serve` running in a
# Terminal window, so XYSY on that machine lived exactly as long as the window stayed open.
# Closing it looked like "xysy.ai forgot this computer". A person should paste the setup ONCE
# and never think about it again - no window to keep open, back by itself after a restart.
#
# So the first time the door runs on a Mac that has no launchd job, it writes one:
# ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.xysy.hermes-serve.plist - the same job already proven on the first
# Mac. The job's command SLEEPS briefly, then WAITS for Hermes' own port (9119) to be free
# before starting `hermes serve`, so the copy launchd manages never fights a serve the person
# started by hand; it simply takes over whenever that one goes away (window closed, crash,
# reboot).
#
# Deliberately NOT done:
#   * never overwrite an existing plist - the first Mac's hand-written job stays untouched;
#   * nothing on Windows/Linux yet - Hermes on Windows is itself unrun; this returns a note
#     instead of guessing at Scheduled Tasks;
#   * no kickstart of the new job now - the serve this door lives in is already the server.
#
# XYSY_PERSIST_NO_LOAD=1 skips the launchctl registration - a test hook, so a test with a
# scratch HOME can prove the plist without planting a job in the REAL launchd session.
